/**
 * Server-side audit-log statistics shared by the Audit Log page
 * (/api/admin/audit) and its PDF report (/api/admin/audit/report), so both
 * compute "active time" the same way.
 *
 * ACTIVE TIME is estimated from activity, not from login/logout. Logout is
 * almost never recorded — people close the tab, and sessions outlive the
 * working day (47 logins vs 1 logout when this was built) — so login→logout
 * would be meaningless. Instead, each user's events are ordered in time and
 * the gap between consecutive events is summed, counting only gaps no longer
 * than IDLE_CUTOFF_SECONDS. A longer gap means they walked away, so it is
 * idle rather than active.
 *
 * The 15-minute cutoff comes from the data: gaps between one user's events
 * cluster heavily under a minute and fall away sharply past 15 minutes.
 *
 * It is a conservative estimate: time spent before the first event after a
 * break (reading, filling in a form before saving) is not visible to the
 * audit trail, and a lone event contributes nothing.
